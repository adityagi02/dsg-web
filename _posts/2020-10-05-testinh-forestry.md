Charlottetown-based [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) announced the close of a $744,000 ($560,000 USD) seed round. With this funding, Forestry.io is the first startup in Canada to close a round of funding that includes an AngelList Syndicate [since its approval by the Ontario Securities Commission](http://betakit.com/angellist-syndicates-finally-launches-in-canada-via-new-osc-program-with-some-caveats/) last year.

Forestry.io’s funding round included an AngelList Syndicate led by noted [Flight.vc](https://angel.co/flight-vc-syndicate)‘s Gil Penchina, who has previously invested in LinkedIn, Cruise Automation, and Dollar Shave Club.

Forestry.io’s content management system is meant to simplify posting and updating material processes on static websites. As more developers move away from using WordPress to build custom websites, there’s a lack of CMS options available that fits into a developer’s workflow. Forestry.io works to bridge this gap.
